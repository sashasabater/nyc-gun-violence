# Examining Gun Violence in NYC from 2006-2020
## Did the propensity of NYPD's controversial Stop-And-Frisk policy curtail gun violence ?

#### I am to explore NYPD's own regularly updated dataset of every shooting incident reported in two parts: From 2006-2013, and from 2013-2020. The year 2013 marks the official disbanding of Stop-and-Frisk, and I aim to see whether there is a statistically significant difference before and after this time period. Additionally I will suplement this dataset with demographics data about various neighborhoods in NYC. In doing so I hope to uncover meaningful relationships between various real life variables (like race, income distribution and housing security).
